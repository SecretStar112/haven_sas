\title{Read and write SAS files.}
\usage{
read_sas(b7dat, b7cat = NULL, encoding = NULL)

write_sas(b7dat, path)
}
\arguments{
\item{b7dat, b7cat}{Path to data and catalog files. The files are
processed with \code{\link[readr]{datasource}()}.}

\item{encoding}{The character encoding used for the file. This defaults to
the encoding specified in the file, or UTF-8. You can use this argument
to override the value stored in the file if it is correct}

\item{path}{Path to file where the data will be written.}
}
\value{
A tibble, data frame variant with nice defaults.

  Variable labels are stored in the "label" attribute of each variable.
  It is not printed on the console, but the RStudio viewer will show it.
}
\description{
Reading supports both b7dat files and the accompanying b7cat files
that are SAS's equivalent of factor labels. There is not currently support
for writing b7cat files.

\examples{
path <- system.file("examples", "iris.sas7bdat", package = "haven")
read_sas(path)
}
