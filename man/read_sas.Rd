}
\arguments{
\item{data_file, catalog_file}{Path to data and catalog files. The files are
processed with \code{\link[readr]{datasource}()}.}

\item{encoding}{The character encoding used for the file. This defaults to
the encoding specified in the file, or UTF-8. You can use this argument

Reading supports both sas7bdat files and the accompanying sas7bdat files
that SAS uses to record value labels. Writing value labels is not currently
supported.
