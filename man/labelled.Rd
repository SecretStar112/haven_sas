\title{Create a labelled vector.}
\usage{
labelled(x, labels)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector to label. Must be either numeric (integer or double) or
character.}

\item{labels}{A named vector. The vector should be the same type as
x. Unlike factors, labels don't need to be exhaustive: only a fraction
of the values might be labelled.}
}
\description{
A labelled vector is a common data structure in other statistical
environments. This class makes it possible to import such labelled vectors
in to without loss of fidelity. This class provides few methods, as I
expect you'll coerce to a standard R class (e.g. a \code{\link{factor}})
soon after importing.

\examples{
sex <- labelled(c("M", "M", "F"), c(M = "Male", F = "Female"))
