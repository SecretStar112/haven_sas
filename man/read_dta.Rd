\title{Read and write Stata DTA files.}
\usage{
read_dta(file, encoding = NULL)

read_stata(file, encoding = NULL)

write_dta(data, path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Either a path to a file, a connection, or literal data
   (either a single string or a raw vector).

   Files ending in \code{.gz}, \code{.bz2}, \code{.xz}, or \code{.zip} will
   be automatically uncompressed. Files starting with \code{http://},
   \code{https://}, \code{ftp://}, or \code{ftps://} will be automatically
   downloaded. Remote gz files can also be automatically downloaded &
   decompressed.

   Literal data is most useful for examples and tests. It must contain at
   least one new line to be recognised as data (instead of a path).}

\item{encoding}{The character encoding used for the file. This defaults to
the encoding specified in the file, or UTF-8. But older versions of Stata
(13 and earlier) did not store the encoding used, and you'll need to
specify manually. A commonly used value is "Win 1252".}

\item{data}{Data frame to write.}

\item{path}{Path to a file where the data will be written.}
}
\value{
A tibble, data frame variant with nice defaults.

  Variable labels are stored in the "label" attribute of each variable.
  It is not printed on the console, but the RStudio viewer will show it.
}
\description{
Currently haven can read and write logical, integer, numeric, character
and factors. See \code{\link{labelled}} for how labelled variables in
Stata are handled in R.
}
\examples{
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".dta")
write_dta(mtcars, tmp)
read_dta(tmp)
read_stata(tmp)
